You should look at the \"Algebra\" playlist if you've never seen algebra before or if you want instruction on topics in Algebra II.  Use this playlist to see a ton of example problems in every topic in the California Algebra I Standards.  If you can do all of these problems on your own, you should probably test out of Algebra I (seriously).","items":[{"name":"Solving Equations 1","video":"solving-equations-1"},{"name":"Solving
